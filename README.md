# 🧠 Operating System Simulator (C#)

This project simulates various components of an operating system such as process scheduling, memory management, and file systems using C#.

---

## 📌 Features

- Process scheduling (Round Robin, FCFS, etc.)
- Memory allocation strategies (fixed, dynamic)
- File system simulation (directory creation, deletion, access)
- Disk scheduling algorithms
- Process states and transitions
- Paging & Segmentation (if implemented)

---

## 📁 Structure 
| Key | Description | File |
|-----|-------------|------|
| process_scheduling | Round Robin algorithm | `RoundRobin.cs` |
| memory_management | Static memory allocation simulation | `MemoryAllocation.cs` |
| file_system | Simple file system operations simulation | `FileSystemSim.cs` |
| disk_scheduling | Disk algorithm simulations | `DiskScheduling.cs` |
| paging | Paging simulation code | `PagingSim.cs` |
| main | Program entry point and user interface | `Main.cs` |
